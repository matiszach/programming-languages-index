# **TIOBE Index for February 2025**

### February Headline: Fast, faster, fastest!  
Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index. Programming language C++ climbed to position 2 recently, Go has become a steady top 10 player, and Rust is at an all-time high of 1.47%. Moreover, fast languages Mojo and Zig are knocking on the top 50 door at positions #51 and #56, respectively.

You might wonder how Python, known as a slow language, is able to survive next to these race monsters. This is because there is another driver nowadays except for performance: how easy is it to learn a new programming language. Apart from crunching more numbers, the world also needs more programmers. Developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet. Hence, the demand for new programmers is still very high. Since the number of graduated software engineers is lower than is needed, all kind of non-software engineers are jumping on the programming bandwagon, and their favorite language is Python. This is why Python is here to stay.  

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming   
languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of   
skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites  
Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.  
It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language  
in which most lines of code have been written.

The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a   
strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new   
software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.
